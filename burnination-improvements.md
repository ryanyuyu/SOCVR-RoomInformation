###Burnination Improvement

Random thoughts about how to further improve the burnination process.

1. Burnination should start with a snapshot of the tag(s).
This could be taken from a SEDE query prior to [status-planned], or before [featured].
This is source data to track disposition of the questions.

2. Related to (1), status should be reported against the pre-burn snapshot.
I'd like to see what actions have been done to each question, including downvotes to Q&A, flags (?), close, deletes.
Ideally this should be automated / scripted to run daily, including an update of a specific "status report" answer on the burn question.

3. GRAPHS! Visualization of progress is super fun.
